## Crash Collection User Consent

Example mobile application designed to showcase crash collection using Instana Android Agent with user consent.

This app showcases the simplest use case of the Instana Android Agent in an Android app written using:
- Kotlin
- Coroutines
- OkHttp3

##### Compiling

Open [ExampleApp.kt](https://github.com/instana/awesome-eum/blob/master/android-crash-user-consent/app/src/main/java/com/instana/android/example/ExampleApp.kt) and replace these two values with your own (obtained in your Instana Dashboard): 
1. `REPORTING_URL`
2. `KEY`

Compile as usual using Android Studio 3.x

##### Structure

- Instana dependencies in [project-level gradle.build](https://github.com/instana/awesome-eum/blob/master/android-crash-user-consent/build.gradle)
- Instana plugin and dependencies in [module-level gradle.build](https://github.com/instana/awesome-eum/blob/master/android-crash-user-consent/app/build.gradle)
- Minimal initialization of Instana Agent in [ExampleApp.kt](https://github.com/instana/awesome-eum/blob/master/android-crash-user-consent/app/src/main/java/com/instana/android/example/ExampleApp.kt)
- Set view name in `onResume()` in [MainActivity.kt](https://github.com/instana/awesome-eum/blob/master/android-crash-user-consent/app/src/main/java/com/instana/android/example/MainActivity.kt)
- OkHttp3 and coroutines to execute a single query which Instana automatically tracks
