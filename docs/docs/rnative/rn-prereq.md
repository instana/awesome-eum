## Setting Up
1. **Install Node.js and npm**
   - Download and install from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install React Native CLI**
   - Open a terminal and run `npm install -g react-native-cli` to install globally.

3. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - Download and install JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio Code or Android Studio/Xcode).

## Optional
- **Physical Devices**
  - For testing and debugging apps directly on Android or iOS devices.

- **Expo CLI**
  - `npm install -g expo-cli` to install globally.
