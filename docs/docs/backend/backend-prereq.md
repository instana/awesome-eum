# ðŸ”– Prerequesties for Springboot Development

## System Requirements

### Operating System
- **Windows**: Windows 7/8/10
- **Mac**: macOS 10.10 or higher
- **Linux**: Any modern distribution

### Hardware
- **RAM**: At least 8 GB (16 GB recommended)

## Software Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - **JDK 17 or higher**: Required for Spring Boot development.

2. **IntelliJ IDEA**
   - The IDE for Java development. The Community Edition is free, but the Ultimate Edition offers more features for Spring development.

3. **Spring Boot**
   - Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development of Java applications.

4. **Maven or Gradle**
   - Build automation tools. Maven is more commonly used for Spring Boot, but Gradle is also supported.

## Tools
1. **IntelliJ IDEA**
   - Download from the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

2. **Spring Boot**
   - You can use Spring Initializr to generate the initial project structure.
   - Alternatively, you can create a new Spring Boot project directly within IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **Maven or Gradle**
   - Maven: Download from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions.
   - Gradle: Download from the [official website](https://gradle.org/install/) and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Version Control System**
   - **Git**: For source code management and collaboration. You can use platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

## Setting Up
1. **Install JDK**
   - Download and install from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

2. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**
   - Download from the [IntelliJ IDEA website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
   - Follow the installation instructions to set up IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **Set Up Git**
   - Download and install from [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
   - Configure your Git settings and create a repository for your project.

4. **Create a Spring Boot Project**
   - Use Spring Initializr: Visit [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a project with the required dependencies.
   - In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to `File > New > Project`, select `Spring Initializr`, and follow the prompts to create your project.


By meeting these prerequisites, you'll be well-equipped to start developing/running Spring Boot applications with IntelliJ IDEA.
